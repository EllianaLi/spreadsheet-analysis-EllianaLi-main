'''Import data into a spreadsheet
Import your newly-scrubbed data file into a sheet in the spreadsheet program of your choice,
such as Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Apple Numbers, or Libre Office. If it doesn't import correctly,
keep working on the scrubbing of your data until it does!
Calculate aggregate statistics

Use formulas to calculate four different aggregate statistics based on your data, such as mean, maximum, minimum,
 etc of one or more entire columns in the data. Place a clear label for each statistic in a neighboring cell.

Calculate aggregate statistics with conditions
Use formulas to calculate four different aggregate statistics based on specific criteria you define, such as mean,
maximum, minimum, etc of only those rows that match the given criterion or multiple criteria. Place a clear label for
each statistic in a neighboring cell so that someone viewing your spreadsheet can easily understand exactly what each
statistic represents.

Be sure to use the database-like functions appropriate to your spreadsheet program
(e.g. AVERAGEIF, MAXIF, MINIF, SUMIF, etc for most spreadsheet programs; Microsoft Excel also has DAVERAGE, DMAX, DMIN, etc ).
